# Azure Cosmos DB Playground

Built with [Azure Cosmos DB vNext emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-linux) and [Codapi](https://codapi.org/), the Azure Cosmos DB Playground is an interactive, browser-based playground for learning and experimenting with [Azure Cosmos DB SQL queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cosmos-db/query/overview) without any setup, installation, or cloud costs.

**Access a hosted version on https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-playground**, or deploy your own instance on an Azure VM by following the [deployment instructions](./docs/azure-deployment.md).

Useful for prototyping, learning, teaching, and sharing:

- Experiment with queries, and see results instantly
- Use pre-loaded datasets or load your own data
- Generate shareable links to your code or embed interactive examples in documentation, blog posts, and tutorials.
