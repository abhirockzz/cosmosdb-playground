# Azure Cosmos DB Playground Features

The Azure Cosmos DB Playground offers an interactive environment to learn, prototype, and share Cosmos DB SQL queries using JSON datasets.

> Check out the FAQ section in the [docs](faq.md) if you have other questions.

## Explore with Pre-Loaded Datasets and Queries

Choose from built-in datasets, each paired with ready-to-run query examples. You can run these queries immediately to see how the data is structured and queried. You can modify these datasets or the queries - this lets you explore and observe how those changes affect query behavior and results.

## Custom Data – Bring Your Own JSON

Paste `JSON` directly into the editor or upload a `JSON` file from your machine. You can then write queries from scratch and experiment using your own data models and examples.

## Share Runnable Examples with a Link

Generate a shareable link that captures both the current dataset and the query. Anyone opening the link lands in the same state and can immediately run, modify, and experiment with the example.

## Pick Up Where You Left Off

When you refresh the page or reopen the tab, you can restore your last dataset and query (in case you made changes to them). This makes it easier to explore ideas over time without losing your previous work.

## Embed Interactive Examples Anywhere

Embed the playground into external sites such as blogs, documentation, or tutorials. Readers can interact with live data and queries directly alongside the written content.
